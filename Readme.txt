About this app:

The sports finder app will help locate local athletes based on a desired sport and location. As avid sports players, we decided an app that would help locate and gather other local players would be useful to broaden our local network, to enjoy different play styles, and to compete with new people. When initially opening the app, each user will start out by either creating a new profile or logging into an existing profile. Each user’s profile will include the player’s name, zip code, win/loss ratio, preferred sports, contact information, and skill level. Once the user has logged in or created a profile, the user will be directed to the sports page where the user will choose the desired sport. From the sports page, the user will then be directed to the search page in which the user can enter a desired zip code to locate nearby players. Once players have been located, the user will be able to select a user and send them an invitation to play.
