About this app:

Pitchers and Catchers will help locate local athletes based on a desired sport and location. As avid sports players, we decided an app that would help locate and gather other local players would be useful to broaden our local network, to enjoy different play styles, and to compete with new people. When initially opening the app, each user will start out by either creating a new profile or logging into an existing profile. Each user’s profile will include the player’s name, zip code, win/loss ratio, preferred sports, contact information, and skill level. Once the user has logged in or created a profile, the user will be directed to the sports page where the user will choose the desired sport. From the sports page, the user will then be directed to the search page in which the user can enter a desired zip code to locate nearby players. Once players have been located, the user will be able to select a user and send them an invitation to play.

The current status of the application:
  
Current features of Pitchers and Catchers include user account creation along with an attached profile page. Users can also create their own tournament brackets to compete with others. Communication with other users is possible through a messaging activity, which makes it possible to request matches. It also possible to locate other users in your area, as well as allowing other users to find you, through a working google maps activity. All of these activities our located in our [VIEWS DIRECTORY](app/src/main/java/com/cs3398/sportsapp/View/MapsActivity.java). 

There is also a backend that includes databases for storing user information. There are existing databses that store messages, user friends, and general user information such as location and sports preferences. The databases and their functions may be found in our MODEL DIRECTORY. This directory also includes the essential base classes for the users and brackets.
